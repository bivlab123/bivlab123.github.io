Welcome to the webpage of the **Brain-Inspired Vision Laboratory (BIVLab)**. We are based in the [Department of Automation, School of Information Science and Technology at the University of Science and Technology of China](https://sist.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm). We aim to address real-world problems through deep-learning approaches and bring artificial intelligence into our daily life. To this purpose, we maintain a research agenda that balances methods and applications. Some of our current areas of interest are:
- **Large Langauge Models** (NEW Topic!ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥), e.g., language agent, multi-modal LLM
- **Diffusion Models** (NEW Topic!ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥), e.g., image generation, video generation
- **Perception for autonomous driving**, e.g., 2D/3D/multi-modal object detection, multi-view 3D object detection, semantic segmentation, and depth estimation
- **Model/data compression**, e.g., knowledge distillation, domain adaptation, semi-supervised learning, and data evaluation
- **Image quality improvement under adverse conditions**, e.g., image enhancement, image dehazing, image deblurring, and multi-task degradation restoration
- **Algorithm designing for image reconstruction**, e.g., self-supervised learning, signal processing, and optimization methods
- **Human behavior analysis**, e.g., facial expression recognition, micro-expression recognition, action recognition, and multi-modal expression recognition
- **OOD generalization**, e.g., domain generalization and shortcut learning
- **Brain-inspired intelligence learning**, e.g., neuron classification and morphology analysis


<!-- Welcome to the webpage of the **Brain-Inspired Vision Laboratory (BIVLab)**. We are based in the
 [Department of Automation, School of Information Science and Technology 
at the University of Science and Technology of China](https://sist.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm).

At BIV Lab, we work at both low-level and high-level computer vision tasks. We aim to address 
real-world problems through deep-learning approaches and bring artificial intelligence into 
our daily life. To this purpose, we maintain a research agenda that balances methods and 
applications. Some of our current areas of interest are:

- **Perception for autonoumous driving** (e.g. 2D/3D/multi-modal object detection, multi-view 3D object detection, semantic segmentation, depth estimation).
- **Model/data compression** (e.g. knowledge distillation, domain adaptation, semi-supervised learning, data evaluation).
- **Image quality improvement under adverse conditions** (e.g. image enhancement, image dehazing, image deblurring, multi-task degradation restoration).
- **Algorithm designing for image reconstruction** (e.g. self-supervised learning, signal processing, optimization methods).
- **Human Behavior Analysis** (e.g. facial expression recognition, micro-expression recognition, action recognition, multi-modal expression recognition).
- **OOD generalization** (e.g. domain generalization, shortcut learning).
- **Brain-inspired Intelligence Learning** (e.g. Neuron classificationï¼ŒMorphology analysis). -->
