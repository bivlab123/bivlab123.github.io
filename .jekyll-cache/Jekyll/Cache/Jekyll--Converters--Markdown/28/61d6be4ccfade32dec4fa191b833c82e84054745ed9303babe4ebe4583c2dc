I"ü<p>Welcome to the webpage of the <strong>Brain-Inspired Vision Laboratory (BIVLab)</strong>. We are based in the
 <a href="https://sist.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm">Department of Automation, School of Information Science and Technology 
at the Univerisity of Science and Technology of China</a>.</p>

<p>At BIV Lab, we work at both low-level and high-level computer vision tasks. We aim to address 
real-world problems through deep-learning approaches and bring artificial intelligence into 
our daily life. To this purpose, we maintain a research agenda that balances methods and 
applications. Some of our current areas of interest are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Perception for autonoumous driving</strong> (e.g. 2D/3D/multi-modal object detection, multi-view 3D object detection, semantic segmentation, depth estimation).</li>
  <li><strong>Model/data compression</strong> (e.g. knowledge distillation, domain adaptation, semi-supervised learning).</li>
  <li><strong>Image quality improvement under adverse conditions</strong> (e.g. image enhancement, image dehazing, image deblurring, multi-task degradation restoration).</li>
  <li><strong>Algorithm designing for image reconstruction</strong> (e.g. self-supervised learning, signal processing, optimization methods).</li>
</ul>
