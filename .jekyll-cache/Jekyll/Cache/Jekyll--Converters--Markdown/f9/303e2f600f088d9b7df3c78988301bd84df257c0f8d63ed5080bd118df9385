I"ó<p>Welcome to the webpage of the Brain-Inspired Vision Laboratory (BIVLab). We are based in the Department of Automation, School of Information Science and Technology at the University of Science and Technology of China.
At BIV Lab, we work at both low-level and high-level computer vision tasks. We aim to address real-world problems through deep-learning approaches and bring artificial intelligence into our daily life. To this purpose, we maintain a research agenda that balances methods and applications. Some of our current areas of interest are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Perception for  autonomous driving</strong> (e.g., 2D/3D/multi-modal object detection, multi-view 3D object detection, semantic segmentation, and depth estimation)</li>
  <li><strong>Model/data compression</strong> ( e.g., knowledge distillation, domain adaptation, semi-supervised learning, and data evaluation)</li>
  <li><strong>Image quality improvement under adverse conditions</strong> ( e.g., image enhancement, image dehazing, image deblurring, and multi-task degradation restoration)</li>
  <li><strong>Algorithm designing for image reconstruction</strong> ( e.g., self-supervised learning, signal processing, and optimization methods)</li>
  <li><strong>Human behavior analysis</strong> ( e.g., facial expression recognition, micro-expression recognition, action recognition, and multi-modal expression recognition)</li>
  <li><strong>OOD generalization</strong> ( e.g., domain generalization and shortcut learning).</li>
  <li><strong>Brain-inspired intelligence learning</strong> (e.g. neuron classification and morphology analysis)</li>
</ul>
