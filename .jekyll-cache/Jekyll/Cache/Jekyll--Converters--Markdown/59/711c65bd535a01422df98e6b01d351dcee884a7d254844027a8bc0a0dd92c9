I"q<p>Welcome to the webpage of the <strong>Brain-Inspired Vision Laboratory (BIVLab)</strong>. We are based in the <a href="https://sist.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm">Department of Automation, School of Information Science and Technology at the University of Science and Technology of China</a>.
At BIV Lab, we work at both low-level and high-level computer vision tasks. We aim to address real-world problems through deep-learning approaches and bring artificial intelligence into our daily life. To this purpose, we maintain a research agenda that balances methods and applications. Some of our current areas of interest are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Perception for  autonomous driving</strong> (e.g., 2D/3D/multi-modal object detection, multi-view 3D object detection, semantic segmentation, and depth estimation)</li>
  <li><strong>Model/data compression</strong> ( e.g., knowledge distillation, domain adaptation, semi-supervised learning, and data evaluation)</li>
  <li><strong>Image quality improvement under adverse conditions</strong> ( e.g., image enhancement, image dehazing, image deblurring, and multi-task degradation restoration)</li>
  <li><strong>Algorithm designing for image reconstruction</strong> ( e.g., self-supervised learning, signal processing, and optimization methods)</li>
  <li><strong>Human behavior analysis</strong> ( e.g., facial expression recognition, micro-expression recognition, action recognition, and multi-modal expression recognition)</li>
  <li><strong>OOD generalization</strong> ( e.g., domain generalization and shortcut learning).</li>
  <li><strong>Brain-inspired intelligence learning</strong> (e.g. neuron classification and morphology analysis)</li>
